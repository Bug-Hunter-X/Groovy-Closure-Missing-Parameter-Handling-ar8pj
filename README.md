This example demonstrates a common error in Groovy when working with closures: not properly handling parameters passed to the closure.  The `myMethod` function doesn't provide any arguments to the closure, leading to a `NullPointerException` within the closure's body. This is a frequent source of unexpected errors in Groovy applications, especially when dealing with closures that expect parameters.
